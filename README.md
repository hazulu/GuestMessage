# guest-message
a plugin for vanilla forums

Adds a fixed message for all guests browsing your site.

Adds a box in the bottom right hand corner with a message to all guests.

You can customize the message in the plugin settings, and you can include html to create links.

You can change the style of the box in the **style.css** file located in the plugin folder.

I included a very basic design that still looks elegant so take it upon yourself to make it compliment your theme!

**Change Log:**

- **0.3**: Added an option to add a close button to the message. After 30 days the message will reappear for the guest. The standard message will show without a close button even if a user has previously clicked the close button while you had it active.

- **0.2**: Fixed a mapping issue to the css file in the plugin folder. The link was not capitalized correctly.

- **0.1**: Base
